facebook_search is a application for search a keyword from facebook. The results are storing to elastic search database. 
I am using facebook graph api for performing facebook search. You need to install elastic search before performing the operations. 
You need to get the access token from facebook. So visit https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer?method=GET&path=me%3Ffields%3Did%2Cname&version=v2.0
